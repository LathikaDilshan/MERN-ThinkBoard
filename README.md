# MERN-ThinkBoard

**MERN-ThinkBoard** is a full-stack note-taking web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This project was developed as part of my learning journey to master the MERN stack, following the tutorial by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## 📚 Tutorial Reference

This project is based on the YouTube tutorial:
